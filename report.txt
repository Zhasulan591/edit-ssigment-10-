Final Report: Kazakhstan's First Digital Rehabilitation Center Website
1. Design Decisions

The design of the website was centered around creating a user-friendly, modern, and responsive interface that reflects the innovative nature of the Digital Rehabilitation Center. Key design decisions include:

    Minimalistic and Clean Layout: The website uses a clean and minimalistic design to ensure easy navigation and readability. The use of white space and clear typography enhances the user experience.

    Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Media queries were used to adjust layouts and styles for different screen sizes.

    Color Scheme: The primary color scheme includes shades of blue (#007bff) and white, symbolizing trust, professionalism, and cleanliness. Accent colors like green and orange were used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and highlights.

    Typography: The Roboto font was chosen for its modern and clean appearance, ensuring readability across all devices.

    Interactive Elements: Interactive features like hover effects on cards, accordions, and carousels were added to engage users and make the website more dynamic.

    Accessibility: The website was designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML, and ARIA labels for screen readers.

2. Tools and Libraries Used

The following tools and libraries were used to build the website:

    Bootstrap 5: Used for the responsive grid system, pre-styled components (navbar, cards, carousel, etc.), and utility classes.

    Google Fonts: The Roboto font was imported from Google Fonts for consistent typography.

    Font Awesome and Bootstrap Icons: Used for social media icons and other graphical elements.

    JavaScript: Used for interactive features like form validation, carousel functionality, and alert messages.

    Google Maps API: Embedded for the contact section to display the location of the center.

    CSS Custom Styles: Custom CSS was written to override Bootstrap styles and add unique design elements.

    CDN Links: All libraries (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Google Fonts) were loaded via CDN for faster loading times.

3. Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

    Responsive Design:

        Challenge: Ensuring the website looked good on all screen sizes, especially mobile devices.

        Solution: Used Bootstrap's grid system and media queries to adjust layouts, font sizes, and images for different screen sizes. Tested the website on multiple devices and browsers.

    Form Submission Handling:

        Challenge: Preventing the form from submitting and showing an alert instead.

        Solution: Added an event listener to the form using JavaScript to intercept the submission, prevent the default behavior, and display an alert.

    Carousel Functionality:

        Challenge: Making the carousel auto-play and ensuring smooth transitions between slides.

        Solution: Used Bootstrap's built-in carousel component and configured it with data-bs-ride and data-bs-interval attributes.

    Accessibility:

        Challenge: Ensuring the website was accessible to all users, including those using screen readers.

        Solution: Added ARIA labels, semantic HTML tags, and ensured proper contrast ratios for text and background colors.

    Performance Optimization:

        Challenge: Reducing load times for the website, especially with multiple images and external libraries.

        Solution: Compressed images, used CDN links for libraries, and minimized custom CSS and JavaScript files.

    Cross-Browser Compatibility:

        Challenge: Ensuring the website worked consistently across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

        Solution: Tested the website on multiple browsers and used vendor prefixes for CSS properties where necessary.
